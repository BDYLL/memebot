## Synopsis

Memetor builds memes by processing messages in natural language on FB Messenger. Memetor looks for images about the topic and then edit the image by adding a joke in it. The user has the option to censorship or block [NSFW](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=NSFW) content, this means jokes about hitler, rape, dead childrens, racism, sexism, etc, are not included. This bot is planned to be used only with academic purposes and not to offend people.
